Notes: 
Sorry that the submission was late by an hour or so. I wanted to do threading so i could learn how, but it turns out there are serious bugs with the 'stream' system in an actual build - I had to find a way to move function calls for monobehaviours back to the main thread to solve this bug.

Eventually I found https://github.com/PimDeWitte/UnityMainThreadDispatcher this small script that helped me fix my code (after I figured out why it wouldn't install or run properly, it is out of date.)

What a stressful hour. I was convinced it wasn't going to work at all.
